artificaldata.py
DirtyDF 
- Will want a better function for get_full_history 
- Goal is to ensure that the corresponding exported file is something that can be read + understood easily

HistoryDF
- Could insert any other statistics we deem important to be stored either for debugging / for the user

Combiner
- Logic for randomisation order of stainers 
- Logic to verify that a provided order of stainers is feasible

stainer.py
Stainer 
- Each stainer needs some ideas as to what different "degrees" would signify and probably document them well
- If any other arguments are required specific to the stainer, would have to be added accordingly and documented 
- Each stainer should have a transform method that will 
    1. Update the df within the ddf class
    2. Update the actions text within the ddf class

Reading Input
- End product is likely someone entering data in a specific format (CSV?) and then we have a class that will interpret the data and create the relevant stainers.
E.g. For something like 
TYPE,DEG,FIXED_ROWS,FIXED_COLS,OTHER_1,OTHER_2
0,0.1,[0,1,2,3],[],True,5

It could be fed in to create AddDuplicate(0.1, [0,1,2,3], [], True, 5) object

- Will also need to consider how information about the DF can be considered (e.g. If certain columns should be categorical, or to not touch certain columns)
