Sampling from a Sample
======================

The `samplers` module contains a set of functions for generating samples from
a *random i.i.d sample*. The output random variates should have similar 
distribution to the input sample.

The aim is different from bootstrapping, where we resample from the same
values. Here, we will obtain from a smoother distribution.

The basic problem is this: We are given an i.i.d sample X_1, X_2, .., X_n from a
density f. We wish to generate Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_m from the same unknown
density. This is a difficult problem, but some progress is possible. 

A good, detailed exposition of the methods implemented here can be found in
[DEV1986]_.

These are the functions that are present in this module:

rand_bartlett():
    Generate random variates from Bartlett kernel. (Helper)

rand_from_density():
    Generate new sample from a kernel density estimate.

rand_from_hist():
    Generate a new sample from a histogram estimate.

rand_from_Finv():
    Generate a new sample from an estimate of F-inverse.
